# Beatson BioProject Annotation Web-Application

## Aim
The Beatson BioProject Annotation Web-Application aims to help researchers at the Beatson Institute of Cancer Research to find entries from the NCBI BioProject database that are relevant to their research, despite their inconsistent and/or incomplete metadata fields. It can be used to annotate and predict annotations BioProjects, with fields that serve the researchers' specific research goals.

## Features
### Annotate
The **Annotate** tab allows users to explore a subset of the BioProject database, to annotate it with their fields of interest.

• There are search and filter functionalities to help discover relevant projects and view details about them.

• New labels can be created for annotation, or chosen from a drop-down list of the labels already used.

### Search
The **Search** tab allows to search for more projects, directly from the full BioProject database, to supplement the local dataset and strengthen annotations.

• The search results can be added to the dataset, so they can be annotated in the **Annotate** tab.

• All search results at once or a smaller selection can be added to the dataset.

### Predict
The **Predict** tab allows to run a prediction algorithm to get predictions for all unannotated projects, based on the existing annotations

• Each prediction comes with a score for the algorithm's confidence in it.

• Predictions can be confirmed or corrected through manual annotation.

• To best improve the future performance of the algorithm, users are given suggestions for the projects to annotate next, based on lowest confidence score.
